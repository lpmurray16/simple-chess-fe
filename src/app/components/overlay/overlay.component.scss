                          The user said "pop onto a players screen", usually implies blocking or at least visual dominance.
                          Let's keep pointer-events: none so it doesn't interrupt game flow if they want to click something else? 
                          Actually, 5 seconds is short, but maybe blocking is better to force attention.
                          Let's remove pointer-events: none for now to ensure it's seen as an overlay. */
